📘 **About Me**  

I recently graduated with a Master’s in Computer Science from the **New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)**, USA, and I’m actively seeking full-time **Software Engineer roles** focused on **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI-driven technologies**.  

I’ve been actively experimenting with **RAGs and LLMs**, and I’m in the process of developing **three products** — two in the **health domain** and one in **agriculture**. Through these projects, I’ve been working on:  
- **Prompt Engineering** — crafting reliable prompts to reduce hallucinations and boost performance.  
- **Content Generation & Summarization** — turning fragmented information into actionable insights.  
- **Workflow Automation & Data Extraction** — building AI-powered pipelines that make data usable and scalable.

🔥 Always curious, always shipping — whether it’s scaling backend systems, experimenting with neural architectures, or bringing generative AI to life.
