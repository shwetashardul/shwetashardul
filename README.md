📘 **About Me**  

I recently graduated with a Master’s in Computer Science from the **New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)**, USA, and I’m actively seeking full-time **Software Development roles** focused on **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI-driven technologies**.  

I’ve been actively experimenting with **RAGs and LLMs**, and I’m in the process of developing **three products** — two in the **health domain** and one in **agriculture**. Through these projects, I’ve been working on:  
- **Prompt Engineering** — crafting reliable prompts to reduce hallucinations and boost performance.  
- **Content Generation & Summarization** — turning fragmented information into actionable insights.  
- **Workflow Automation & Data Extraction** — building AI-powered pipelines that make data usable and scalable.

🔥 Always curious, always shipping — whether it’s scaling backend systems, experimenting with neural architectures, or bringing generative AI to life.  


🔬 **Graduate Research Assistant | Deep Learning & Neural Collapse**

I'm currently working at NJIT as a Graduate Research Assistant exploring the intersection of **theoretical machine learning and empirical deep learning**. My research investigates how neural networks learn and generalize, with a special focus on **neural collapse**.

Key focus areas include:
- 🧠 Characterizing neural collapse across deep architectures
- 📊 Studying memorization vs. generalization in overparameterized networks
- 📏 Designing metrics to quantify training behavior and learning phases
- ⚡ Improving robustness, efficiency, and reliability in deep learning systems

This work fuels my passion for understanding the fundamentals of AI and contributes toward advancing theoretical and practical applications of deep learning.
