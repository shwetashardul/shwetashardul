🔬 **Graduate Research Assistant | Deep Learning & Neural Collapse**

I'm currently working at NJIT as a Graduate Research Assistant exploring the intersection of **theoretical machine learning and empirical deep learning**. My research investigates how neural networks learn and generalize, with a special focus on **neural collapse**.

Key focus areas include:
- 🧠 Characterizing neural collapse across deep architectures
- 📊 Studying memorization vs. generalization in overparameterized networks
- 📏 Designing metrics to quantify training behavior and learning phases
- ⚡ Improving robustness, efficiency, and reliability in deep learning systems

This work fuels my passion for understanding the fundamentals of AI and contributes toward advancing theoretical and practical applications of deep learning.
